This Repo Is Really Only Made For Me I'll Decide Later If I Want To Make It Public.

But basically each section each folder (ex. manipulating, scoreKeeper) are project that I did or codded along while 
using this course (https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/). 


My next project will be to complete this challenge (https://jsbeginners.com/javascript-projects-for-beginners/) 
over the next few days to sharpen my coding skills.
