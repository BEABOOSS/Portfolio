This Repo Is Really Only Made For Me I'll Decide Later If I Want To Make It Public.

But basically each section and folder (ex. manipulating, scoreKeeper, etc...) are project that I did or codded along while 
doing this [course][course]. 

Before going back to the [course][course] other half. I'll be doing a [challenge][challenge].
My next project will be to complete this [challange][challenge] over the next few days to sharpen my coding skills.
